## Overview
This repository is my machine learning toolbox. It contains models that I have created from scratch.

## Models

### Dimensionality Reduction,
* MDS.py – Multidimensional Scaling
* PCA.py – Principal Component Analysis

### Neural Networks,

* Hopfield.py – Hopfield Network
* RBF.py – Radial Basis Function Network
* RBM.py – Restricted Boltzmann Machine
* SLP.py – Single Layer Perceptron
* MLP.py – Multilayer Perceptron

### Machine Learning,
* SVM.py – Support Vector Machine
* ransac.py - Random Sample Consensus
